 - this problem is no trivial task
 - Name of the problem : the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem
 - finding the optimal solution is probable but unlikely
 - the naive approach of expanding space and time into a single graph does not work for large networks, there are smarter ways
 - might use dikstra but instead of distance use time, it is possible to handle both but the inputs need to be proper
 - maps as a measure of time

RAPTOR ALGORITHM
 - trip represents a sequence of stops plus associated arrival and departure times on each stop
 - group all trips by their sequence of stops, ignoring the time information, then each group of trips sharing the same sequence of stops forms a route
 - Tipically, there are more trips than routes.
