# TripMate: Multimodal Travel Planner
___

## Theme Description
The daily public transport user frequently feels the need to make several trips depending on the activities that are planned for a specific day. For example, a student that usually travels from his home to school and back, but might also need to travel somewhere else for his football practice.  
The main goal of this project is to make the user's life easier. For this, the application has to be provided the user's schedule (the time at which the activity begins, the estimated time and the location) and a starting location. This will allow the application to calculate and suggest the quickest itenerary (using public transportation, walking or a mix of both ways) to the user, if possible the suggested itenerary will allow the user to get to the location in time for the next activity). Everytime the user adds a new activity to the agenda, the itenerary is recalculated.
